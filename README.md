# *Am I Isolated*

*Am I Isolated* is a security posture benchmarking tool.

It evaluates a given runtime environment and attempts to look for things
which may be a security problem, as well as providing suggestions for
solving the security problem.

Security is a rapidly evolving space: it is intended that *Am I Isolated* is
updated over time to incorporate new and relevant security research
relating to jailing containers.

*Am I Isolated* is also still a work in progress and does not yet incorporate
tests for all possible container security problems.  Current work is
focused on providing enough data in a digestable format, rather than
overwhelming security engineers and CISOs with too much data.

## Using *Am I Isolated*

In general you will want to use the OCI image:

```sh
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/edera-dev/am-i-isolated:nightly
```

For examples of how to run *Am I Isolated* in different environments, see the
[examples](examples) directory.

You can also build and run directly with Cargo.
